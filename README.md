# Markov_Blackjack

Python project illustrating the principles and problematics of Hidden Markov Models considering a Blackjack game where the dealer cheats using a Markov chain pattern.


Thanks to observations only and using the Baum-Welch algorithm, we are able to predict with a confidence of 80% what strategies the dealer used during a sequence of games.


The prediction in Dynamic Programming is less precised (70% of confidence) but is a common approach to a lot of problems, a fundamental application example being matrices multiplication.


It is possible to play manually with the dealer (in the shell) even though the observations were generated through automatic games between 2 AI (a somewhat rational player and the dealer).


Codes and report are provided in french.

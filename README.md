# Markov_Blackjack

Project illustrating the principles and problematics of Hidden Markov Models considering a Blackjack game where the dealer cheats using a Markov chain pattern.
Based on observations only and thanks to the Baum-Welch algorithm, we are able to predict with a confidence of 80% what strategies the dealer used during a sequence of games.
The prediction in Dynamic Programming is less precised (70% of confidence) but is a common approach to a lot of problems, a fundamental application example being matrices multiplication.
Codes and report are provided in french.
